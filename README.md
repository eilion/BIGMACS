# BIGMACS (v1.0)

This software is for constructing stacks and aligning cores containing benthic Î´18O and 14C records, by following the algorithms in the paper "Bayesian Inference Gaussian Process Multiproxy Alignment of Continuous Signals (BIGMACS): Applications for Paleoceanography" now available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08738, running on MATLAB. Detailed and quick manuals can be found in 'README.pdf' and 'Quick Start Guide.pdf', respectively.
