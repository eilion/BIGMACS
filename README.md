This software is for constructing stacks and aligning cores containing benthic δ18O and 14C records, by following the algorithms in the paper [T. Lee, D. Rand, L. E. Lisiecki, G. Gebbie and C. Lawrence, "Bayesian age models and stacks: combining age inferences from radiocarbon and benthic δ18O stratigraphic alignment", Climate of the Past (2023)] which is now available at https://cp.copernicus.org/articles/19/1993/2023/, running on MATLAB. Manual can be found in 'User Manual.pdf'.
