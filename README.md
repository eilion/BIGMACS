This software is for constructing stacks and aligning cores containing benthic δ18O and 14C records, by following the algorithms in the paper [T. Lee, D. Rand, L. E. Lisiecki, G. Gebbie and C. Lawrence, "Bayesian age models and stacks: combining age inferences from radiocarbon and benthic δ18O stratigraphic alignment"] which is now available at https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2022/egusphere-2022-734/, running on MATLAB. Manual can be found in 'User Manual.pdf'.
