# DPGP-Stack (v1.0)

This software is for constructing stacks and aligning cores containing benthic d18O and 14C records, by following the algorithms in the paper "Dual Proxy Gaussian Process Stack: Integrating Benthic Î´18O and Radiocarbon Proxies for Inferring Ages on Ocean Sediment Cores" now available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08738, running on MATLAB. Detailed and quick manuals can be found in 'README.pdf' and 'Quick Start Guide.pdf', respectively.
